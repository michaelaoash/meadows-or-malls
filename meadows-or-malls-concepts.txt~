The main concepts and skills that students will encounter and practice during this unit are:

General Linear Programmingx
 Seeing that for two-variable problems, the optimal value always occurs at a corner point of the feasible region
 Generalizing the corner-point principle to more than two variables
 Recognizing that for two-variable problems, corner points can be found as the intersections of lines corresponding to constraint equations or inequalities
 Generalizing the method of finding corner points to more than two variables
Solving Linear Equations
 Using substitution, graphing, and guess-and-check methods to solve systems of linear equations in two variables
 Developing and using the elimination method to solve systems of linear equations in two or more variables
 Using the concepts of inconsistent, dependent, and independent systems of equations

Geometry in the Plane and in 3-Space
 Extending the concept of coordinates to three variables by introducing a third axis perpendicular to the first two
 Graphing linear equations in three variables and recognizing that these graphs are planes in 3-space
 Seeing that two distinct points always determine a unique line and that two distinct lines in the plane determine a unique point unless the lines are parallel
 Examining the possible intersections of planes in 3-space
 Relating the possible intersections of lines and planes to the algebra of solving linear systems in two or three variables

Matrix Algebra
 Using matrices to represent information
 Using problem situations to motivate and develop the definitions of matrix addition and multiplication
 Examining whether matrix operations have certain properties, such as associativity and commutativity

Matrices and Systems of Linear Equations
 Seeing that systems of linear equations are equivalent to certain types of matrix equations
 Recognizing the role of identity and inverse elements in solving certain types of matrix equations
 Finding matrix inverses by hand by solving systems of linear equations
 Understanding the relationship between a system of linear equations  having a unique solution and the coefficient matrix being invertible
