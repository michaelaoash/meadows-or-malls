A skill that I found challenging at first was using a matrix to represent
 a system of linear equations and then solving an applied situation.
 Matrices could be used to solve Portfolio Piece 5 with Smith and Fernandez
 buying building materials and to represent the unit problem.

\begin_layout Standard
In the unit problem I used a Matrix equation to represent the meadows-or-malls
 problem.
 In the example below rows 1, 2, 3, and 6 represent the four equalities
 of the Meadows or Malls problem, while rows 4 and 5 represent two of the
 eight inequalities set to binding, that is, to equality.

To solve I used Octave—a free software implementation of Matlab—which allowed
 me to run row operations on the matrices.
 I used multiplication, row additions and substitution, and row switching
 to clear each cell beneath the diagonal—with 1's on the diagonal.
 Then I backsubstituted starting with the solution in the final row.

The identity matrix on the left times the variable vector equals the vector
 on the right-hand side, so the variable vector can be matched to the solutions.
 The solution above satisfies the six remaining inequalities, as well as
 the six equalities that I solved with.
 The cost of this situation is $353,750, which turns out to be the cost-minimizi
ng feasible solution.

\begin_layout Standard
In this unit I had to integrate many new and old skills to solve a big,
 complex problem.
 I had to find maximums and minimums within feasible regions represented
 by matrices and systems of inequalities and equalities.
 I used many techniques including row operations and variable substitutions
 in matrices.
 Throughout the unit I found that trying to explain out loud what I was
 doing and had learned helped me further understand concepts and realize
 skills that I still needed to work on.
 This helped me realize the learning benefits I get from collaboration with
 peers and mentors.
 Understanding what benefits my learning can help me learn better in the
 future.
